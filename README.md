# Hangman-game-in-Python

This is my first python project. I created a code for a simple game called Hangman. Hangman is guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. In my program, you can set the guessing word and I also put a maximum tries to 10.

I really enjoy in this project.
